# Python-photoshop
Uses python to create a tkinter and PIL based photoshop copy (More features coming soon!)
Has 19 buttons all to do with editing images.
# How to use?
Run it and you'll see 19 buttons, all labeled with each having 1 class.
Load an image (RGB/Grayscale using filedialog) then press any one of them you want.
You have now edited it.
Press "Save Image" to save it to a file (filedialog, again).
